# Spring Boot Hello World #

## Summary ##

This is an example project to help you get bootstrapped with a Java **Spring MVC** project that also includes **Spring Boot**, and **Gradle**.

In addition to that, developer tools like **Docker** and **Docker-Compose** have been added to get you into the code right away and not worried about the environment you need to deploy to.

## Dependencies ##

* Git
* Java 8 JRE + JDK
* Gradle 4.4+
* Docker
* Docker-Compose
* Intellij IDEA (or another Java IDE or text editor)

## Getting Started ##

Open **Intellij IDEA** or your favorite IDE and import this project into the IDE as a **Gradle** project. Allow your IDE to download **Gradle** for you automatically and pull in the required sources specified in your `build.gradle`.

When you're ready to build you can use **Gradle** to execute `clean` and `build` commands through your IDE or do it through the command-line using the `gradlew` tool.

After you've built your application, it is time to run it. Execute the `run.sh` script in project root.

The project is now running and ready to be used with a Hello World message located at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
